# my_portfolio083
This is my Portfolio that contains my works / projects. Even it is much simple, I can share.

If you want to collaborate with me, just tell me. I am now open...

You can have some copies from my source. But remember and type the username of the owner of this source.

Note: Some mini programs from the directory named "simple_programs" are belong to the programming exercises from some sources where I test my knowledge on what I have learned so far. I hope you understand about this.

BTW, I need a group or partner to create a larger programs or projects so that I can communicate and gaining my teamwork skills.
